			<h2>Hi there...</h2>
			<p>My name is Saswat, and I'm using github pages to keep track of my CV and my efforts to learn javascript.<br>
				I am primarily interested in gaining competency in JS because I like the idea of putting things on the web, without much effort on my part or the part of people who want to view it.<br>
				My interests in JS are to do text scraping, analysis, and visualizations; I also want to make some simple games and art. </p>
