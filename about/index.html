			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Sometime soon, I'll write something good here. <br>
				My name is Saswat, and I'm learning javascript, right now. I hope a better understanding of JS will help me in pursuing other languages. 
			I'm learning JS first, because I want to primarily work on text scraping and analysis and visualizations for health related data, and I went to put these things on the web. 
			Before, I've studied Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and I have a Health Policy M.P.H. from UGA. In my free time, I'm mostly watching films and tv, and thinking about going hiking, but not really actually doing it.
			I'm also a big fan of javascript because you can make cool art and games and "less useful" things with it, too.</p>
