			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Saswat, I currently work as a health economic analyst (making models and stuff). This page is mostly about my efforts to learn javascript for creative as well as utilitarian purposes. I am generally most interested in getting, analyzing, and visualizing data.
				Other things I am into are hiking, climbing (I want to get better), films (I think they're like, really, important, for some reason...), and economics of race, health, and other things.
