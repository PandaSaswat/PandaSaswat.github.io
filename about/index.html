		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Saswat, and currently I do not work as a developer or coder. 
				I like to make things, and right now, I am generally spending my time learning javascript/node.js, and Python. <br>
				I hope to get better at getting, analyzing, and visualizing data through these tools. <br>
				My educational background is in my incomplete CV... <br>
				When I'm not at my computer, I'm trying to get more into becoming a serious hiker, as I'm more like a casual hiker, right now.
