			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Sometime soon, I'll write something good here. <br>
			My name is Saswat, this page is built using github-pages, by me, to keep a web version of my CV and my efforts to learn programming. Javascript, followed by Python is my primary focus, for now. <br>
			I'm teaching myself these things as I'd like to be more capable at acquiring data on my own, using API for use in other sorts of analysis I'm interested in.
			My research interests/experience are mostly in infectious diseases, obesity, and statistical modeling of those things. However, I would like to be doing other things as well, such as text analysis to understand those things.
			Previously I've studied Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and Health Policy at UGA. <br>
		 	In my free time, I'm listening to an embarassing amount of podcasts and radio. I don't know why but I think it's the future of media (???) When I'm not doing that I think a lot about becoming a serious hiker, but I'm more like just a casual hiker... <br>
