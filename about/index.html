title: About Saswat

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Saswat, I currently work as a health economic analyst, and I want to get better at coding. This page is mostly about my efforts to learn python, and javascript for creative as well as utilitarian purposes. I am generally most interested in getting, analyzing, and visualizing data. The type of academic things I'm into are obesity, flu, social networks, and statistical modeling, so maybe that will end up here some day.
			<br>Other stuff I'm into are hiking, climbing (I want to get better), films (I think they're, like, <i>really important</i>, for some reason...), music / boring podcasts (trying to listen to the remaining 400 hours of TAL, right now)...
