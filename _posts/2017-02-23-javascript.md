I got really interested in obtaining data from twitter. Before this point, I had very little idea how to make this happen. 
It is not so hard to actually do this in node with a package called twit (the documentation for this package is great.)

However it has proven to be incredibly difficult to actually put a node app like this online--for a beginner. So far I haven't done it yet.
But, I have learned about gulp, browserify, webpack, linting, express, databases, CORS...and so on. It's kind of overwhelming to learn how vast and huge JS is...

This is definitely not the best project to pursue in the beginning, but at least I feel like I've learned quite a bit. 

I really hope I can figure out how to make this app soon, and move on to other things (maybe fixing my poetry generator thing?)
