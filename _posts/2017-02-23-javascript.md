I got really interested in obtaining data from twitter. Before this point, I had very little idea how to make this happen. 
It is not so hard to actually do this in node with a package called twit (the documentation for this package is great.)

However it has proven to be incredibly difficult to actually put a node app like this online--for a beginner. So far I haven't done it yet.

The reason I wanted to put this node app online is, I wanted to have an easy way to interact with my app, and to perhaps explore saving tweets to a database instead of a text file. Making my app more automated.

Instead I've spent about a week (many hours) trying to make this app easier to use... But, at least, I feel like I've learned a lot. I have learned about gulp, browserify, webpack, linting, express, databases, how to work with these APIs... And also what this CORS thing is, and that you can't just call twitter's API from the browser. 

It's kind of overwhelming to learn how vast JS and web dev is...

I really hope I can figure out how to make this app soon, and move on to other things (maybe fixing my poetry generator thing?)
