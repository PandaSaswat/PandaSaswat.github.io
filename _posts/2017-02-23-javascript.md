JavaScript is vast. I just wanted to my tweet grabber node app on the web so it could be easier to use, but it turns out that's not so easy...

I did learn many things in my quest though... ES6 what is that? Linting, what is that? And so on, gulp, browserify, webpack, express, CORS, databases.....

I really hope I can finish and try to fix some of my other things, and work on making some more (pointless) visualizations, soon.
