Windows is getting harder and harder to use, I never had problems with it before...but now it just seems bad on many fronts.
The privacy issues seem to be the most popular reason for Windows 10 hate, but I am also finding it increasingly difficult to do things I want to do on that OS.

Even if I don't care *that much* about privacy...some of the telemetry physically manifests itself as a nuisance as it causes very high disk usage at times when I'm just idling or using a text editor.
Sometimes I would hear this insanely loud hum as my HDD was spinning so fast, just while the computer is sitting there, as I'm trying to go sleep...

It also can take a lot of CPU power (along with this random Intel Driver telemetry...)

I've deleted those things to the best of my ability, but I'm still not a fan of Windows anymore for other reasons.

I also don't like how turning off ads on the Lock Screen is an opt out thing, versus an opt in thing. It seems really lame that this comes with the Pro version of an OS that isn't free.

Things just seem harder to install on W10, too. And I don't like that it's so hard to customize the way the window manager looks.

I have almost no reason to use the OS anymore.
